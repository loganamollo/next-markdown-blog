We often think of success as a function of an individual's innate endowments and genius; or as a result of their hard work. However, we often fail to see the environmental and societal factors that contributed - just as equally - to their success. Outliers takes us on an exploratory journey learning about the successful, and the not so successful; finding patterns where they exist and trying to make meaning of them.


# The book in detail
## 1. The Mathew effect
When we do ability grouping from an early age, such as in ice hockey, kids who are older by months have a slight advantage. This slight advantage means being placed in an advanced group as they grow a year older; meaning that they get more training and practice. As a result, they have a higher chance of becoming professionals. They started with one slight advantage, being born close  to the cut-off date.
>For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. 
>But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
>~ Gospel of Mathew
## 2. the 10,000 hour rule
>Practice isn't the thing that you do once you're good, it's the thing you do that makes you good.

Bill Gates, The Beatles, Mozart, Bill jean and almost every other succesful person have one thing in common - by the time they attained success in their respective fields, they had ammased 10,000 hours of practice. They were very fortunate to receive such training opportunities. For instance, in the 1970s, computing time was expensive, let alone a 17 year old having had thousands of hours of practice.
>It's all but impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you're a young adult. You have to have parents tho encourage and support you. You can't be poor, because if you have to hold a part-time job on the side to make ends meet, there won't be time left in the day to practice enough

## 3. IQ vs EQ
>The relationship between success and IQ only works up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of about 120, having additional IQ points does'nt translate into any real-world advantage.

There exists a threshold for succesful people. Beyond that threshold, the nenxt differentiating factor becomes [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to empathize and express themselves effectively.

## 4. Origins and Culture
The origin of a person defines - to an extent - the resources available to them, how they are treated and opportunities presented with.
Culture defines their mannerism and their relationship with work and with each other. This includes uncertainity avoidance, love of hardwork, power distance, dialogue orientation (who is responsible if meaning is lost in communication) and culture of honor, where bruteness is used as a means of self assertion.
This plays a huge part in their success, or lack thereof. This, like any other determining factor is - to some extent - malleable.

# What I particularly liked about the book.
I like how it brings some extent of indeterminism to success. It is not simply cast in stone, or in our genes. The deterministic part of it was well brought out. For instance, how tech billionaires have close birthdays, or how the generations of jewish immigrants we're as follows:
cloth maker -> big factory owner -> doctor/ lawyer
It makes success a combination of grit and a bestowment by the muses. As Malcom Gladwell so aptly puts it:
>Success is a gift. It is the giving of an opportunity and having the strength and presence of mind to take it
>~Malcom Gladwell


# Anything I disliked about the book.


# Key takeaways.
Success is a function of wit, grit, upbringing, environment and opportunities. All are in varying degrees malleable. It is our role to be cognizant of what lies outside our sphere of control and what does; and how to tune our bestowments and predicaments towards a more successful path.


# What the book has inspired me to do
The world is not as perfect as I'd like it to be. I have strengths and weaknesses, assumptions and biases. I will continue learning and finding implementations of what I've learnt, all the while being intentional and mindful.
